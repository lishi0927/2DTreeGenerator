## 2DTreeGenerator

A basic application of the space colonization algorithm for tree generation (in 2D).

Current version is able to:

* Generate a simple (elipsis) crown shape and fill it with numerous random attraction points
* Generate a first tree node (trunk) randomly at the bottom of the window
* Resolve the tree with a simple render (made of lines)
